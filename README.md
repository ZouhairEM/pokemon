# Pokémon App

This project was created using React, React Router and Bootstrap UI using a dataset of Pokémon. I mainly created it so that I work with React for the first time, but Pokémon is also something I've loved from my childhood. 

## Setup
There are three main pages, an overview of the first generation of 151 Pokémon, a details page for each Pokémon with extra information and a 404 page. 

### Instructions

If you want to run it locally, the application is relatively straightforward. After copying the code, use **npm install** to install dependencies, followed by **npm run start** in your CLI to run the application. You're free to check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/ZouhairEM/pokemon) as well, if you're curious about the history that went into development.
